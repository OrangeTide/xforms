	* image/image_rotate.c (flimage_rotate): enable the rotation of
	grayscale images by 90degree multiples and more generally prevent
	other unsupported image types from crashing xforms.

	* lib/flresource.c (fl_initialize): clean-up properly if we fail to
	create input contexts or methods.

	* lib/textbox.c (handle_textbox):
	* lib/thumbwheel.c (handle):
	* lib/util.c (flevent): FL_KEYBOARD has been replaced by FL_KEYPRESS.
	The former is retained for compatability, but the latter should be
	used internally.
