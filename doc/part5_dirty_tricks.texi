@node Part V Dirty Tricks
@chapter Dirty Tricks

This chapter describes some of the routines that may be used in
special situations where more power or flexibility from Forms Library
is needed. These routines are classified as "dirty tricks" either
because they can easily mess up the normal operation of Forms Library
or they depend on internal information that might change in the
future, or they rely too much on the underlying window systems. Thus
whenever possible, try not to use these routines.

@node Form Events
@subsection Form Events

It is possible to by-pass the form event processing entirely by
setting a "raw callback" that sits between the event reading and
dispatching stage, thus a sneak preview can be implemented and
optionally consume the event before the internal form processing
machinery gets to it.

Use the following routines to register such a preemptive processing
routine
@tindex FL_RAW_CALLBACK
@findex fl_register_raw_callback()
@anchor{fl_register_raw_callback()}
@example
typedef int (*FL_RAW_CALLBACK)(FL_FORM *, void *xevent);
FL_RAW_CALL_BACK fl_register_raw_callback(FL_FORM *form,
                                          unsigned long mask,
                                          FL_RAW_CALLBACK callback);
@end example
@noindent
where @code{mask} is the event mask you are interested in (same as
the XEvent mask). The function returns the old handler for the event.

Currently only handlers for the following events are supported
@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{KeyPressMask} and @code{KeyReleaseMask}
@item
@code{ButtonPressMask} and @code{ButtonReleaseMask}
@item
@code{EnterWindowMask} and @code{LeaveWindowMask}
@item
@code{ButtonMotionMask} and @code{PointerMotionMask}
@item
@code{FL ALL EVENT} (see below)
@end itemize

Further, there is only one handler for each event pair, (e.g.,
@code{ButtonPress} and @code{ButtonRelease}), thus you can't have two
separate handlers for each pair although it is okay to register a
handler only for one of them (almost always a mistake) if you know
what you're doing. If you register a single handler for more than one
pair of events, e.g., setting mask to
@code{KeyPressMask|ButtonPressMask}, the returned old handler is
random.

A special constant, @code{FL_ALL_EVENT}, is defined so that the
handler registered will received all events that are selected. To
select events, use @code{@ref{fl_addto_selected_xevent()}}.

Once an event handler is registered and the event is detected, then
instead of doing the default processing by the dispatcher, the
registered handler is invoked. The handler must return
@tindex FL_PREEMPT
@code{FL_PREEMPT} if the event is consumed) and 0 otherwise so that
the internal process can continue. See the demo program
@file{minput2.c} for an example.


@node Object Events
@subsection Object Events

Just as you can by-pass the internal event processing for a particular
form, you can also do so for an object. Unlike in raw callbacks, you
can not select individual events.

The mechanism provided is via the registration of a pre-handler for an
object. The pre-handler will be called before the built-in object
handler. By electing to handle some of the events, a pre-handler can,
in effect, replace part of the built-in handler.

In @ref{Part IV Using a Pre-empive Handler, , the chapter about
pre-emptive handlers} the API was already discussed in detail, so here
we just repeat the discussion for completeness as any use of
pre-emptive handler is considered "dirty tricks".

To register a pre-handler, use the following routine
@tindex FL_HANDLEPTR
@findex fl_set_object_prehandler()
@example
typedef int (*FL_HANDLEPTR)(FL_OBJECT *obj, int event,
                            FL_Coord mx, FL_Coord my,
                            int key, void *raw_event);

void fl_set_object_prehandler(FL_OBJECT *, FL_HANDLEPTR prehandler);
@end example
@noindent
where @code{event} is the generic event in the Forms Library, that is,
@code{FL DRAW}, @code{FL ENTER} etc. The arguments @code{mx} and
@code{my} are the mouse position and @code{key} is the key pressed.
The last parameter, @code{raw_event} is a pointer to the XEvent that
caused the invocation of the pre-handler. cast to a void pointer.

Notice that the pre-handler has the same function prototype as the
built-in handler. Actually they are called with the exact same
parameters by the event dispatcher. The prehandler should return 0 if
the processing by the built-in handler should continue. A return value
of @code{FL PREEMPT} will prevent the dispatcher from calling the built-in
handler.

See demo program @file{preemptive.c} for an example.

Similar mechanism exists for registering a post-handler, i.e., a
handler invoked after the built-in handler finishes. Whenever possible
a post-handler should be used instead of a pre-handler.


@node Other
@section Other

As stated earlier, @code{@ref{fl_set_defaults()}} can be used to
modify the Forms Library's defaults prior to calling
@code{@ref{fl_initialize()}}. Actually, this routine can also be used
after @code{@ref{fl_initialize()}} to override the values set on the
command line or in the application databases. However, overriding
users' preferences should be done with discretion. Further, setting
@code{privateColormap} after @code{@ref{fl_initialize()}} has no
effect.
