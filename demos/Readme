Here are a few programs70 demonstrating the usage and appearance of
object classes in the XForms Library. Note that these programs also
serve as testing/QA programs, so if you have a problem with a
particular object, see if the same object works in the demo program.
On the other hand, if one of the demo programs doesn't work you
have rather likely found a bug in XForms. Please report it!

Simply type 'demo' to start the demo/test suite.

OpenGL/Mesa demos may not have been generated if you configured
XForms to be built without GL support (via the '--disable-gl'
option of 'configure').
