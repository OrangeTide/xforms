V1.1 ???????????
  o Reset the horizontal offset of a browser to zero if the
    horizontal scrollbar is turned off (Bug #3205.)
  o Add a fl_replace_xyplot_point_in_overlay function that generalizes
    the existing fl_replace_xyplot_point.
  o Add new accessor functions to query and modify the timeouts that
    control the behaviour of the slider and counter widgets.
  o Enable input widgets to (partially) display characters larger than
    the input height.
  o Pass the associated (XEvent * xev) to fl_handle_object on an FL_DRAW
    event, allowing an FL_FREE object to make use of this info to
    redraw only the part of the window that has changed.
  o Fix compilation on SCO OpenServer, AIX and systems without GNU make.
------------------------------------------
V1.0.91pre7 May xx, 2008
  o New function fl_show_msg() that takes a printf()-like format

    in the format string.

    and fl_show_nsg() automatically have a size that allows all text
    to be shown. Amount of text isn't limited anymore.
  o Vertical scrollbars only ge resized in y-direction, horizontal
    ones only in x-direction.
  o Date input fields now handle leap years correctly.
  o <TAB> can now also be used to "jump" out of multi-line input

  o Memory allocation bug in fl_initialize() fixed.
  o Output of fdesign should now be valid C (ANSI 89)
  o Number of symbols and length of names not limited anymore.
  o Public functions added to set or query for buttons to which
    mouse buttons they react:
     fl_set_button_mouse_buttons()
     fl_get_button_mouse_buttons()
    Per default buttons again react to all mouse buttons.
  o Removed restriction that required one of a set of radio buttons to
    be always active active.
  o Changes to fdesign to set this behaviour.
------------------------------------------

  o Some reorganization of memory allocation handling in lots
    of places to be able to really deallocate unused memory.

    windows which then resulted in X errors.
  o Corrections to make sliders on text browsers work correctly
  o Number of forms that can be created is now not limited anymore.
  o Object and event queue code rewritten to allow queues that grow

------------------------------------------
V1.0RC6.1 November 19, 2002
  o. Fixed early tooltip hide causing recursive fl_free_forms() entry.
  o. Fixed typo in `lib/Imakefile'.

------------------------------------------
V1.0RC6 November 16, 2002
  o. TabFolder coordinate update corrected. (Angus Leeming)
  o. Tooltips could be orphaned when form hidden.  (Angus Leeming)

------------------------------------------
V1.0RC5.2 October 2, 2002
  o. Documented `InstallNonstandard' procedure.

------------------------------------------
V1.0RC5.1 October 1, 2002
  o. Mac OS X build support.

V1.0RC3 June 5, 2002
  o. Fixed condition in forms.c preventing use of cursor keys.
  o. Fumigated with -Wall, eliminating all complaints in xforms
     sources.

------------------------------------------
V1.0RC2	June 1, 2002
  o. Picked up some missing prototypes in `flimage.h'.
  o. Deleted fl_snprintf() with snprintf() and changed all references
     thereto.  Added a new library for those lacking the latter
     function, filched from the SpamAssassin distributon, of all things.
     Had to hack it a bit to get it to work.  Others, on other systems,
     may have to as well.

------------------------------------------
V1.0RC1	May 30, 2002
  o. Very minor API changes.  `FL_ERROR_FUNC' has been typedef'd for
     fl_set_error_handler() function.  `FL_VAL_FILTER' has also been
     typedef'd for use by fl_set_{counter,slider}_filter().  Neither
     of these changes should affect much of anything.
  o. The flimage functions are in their own library now: libflimage.
     They should be usable standalone, but I have not had an
     opportunity to test them.
  o. The OpenGL functions are in their own library now: libformsGL
     fl_add_glcanvas() and its ilk live there.  Application build scripts/
     Makefiles should include -lformsGL.
  o. The Xpm library is no longer built or distributed with XForms.
  o. The majority of the function prototypes in `forms.h' have been
     expanded to include variable names.
